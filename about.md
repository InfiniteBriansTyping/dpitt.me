I'm a developer living in Dallas, TX.  I have a long time background in systems, and am currently focused on cloud automation and distributed systems. I like solving problems.

This site is a space for me to share my enthusiasm for computers, personal ideas, and occasionally some hand waving philosophy of sitting behind a drumset.
