This advice is mostly for me.

To clarify on "adulthood":  That time after you have at least one kid, a career, a marriage, and a mortgage.  It's not one of these things; it's all of them.  An adult human with a career, or a career and a mortgage, or even a career, a marriage and a mortgage, cannot relate to the predicament stated below.  Maybe all it boils down to is parenthood.  It's very possible I'll answer my own questions as this unfolds.

So, I digress.  In my current stage of life, I have three factions of friends.

1. Ones who've been in my life for pretty much half my existence -- high school friends that I've known for 13 - 14 years.  These are friends who were with me through all my 
bullshit, ones who actually _know_ me.  There can be an exception made here in regards to who I was then vs. now, but those are ignored in this case; I'm only thinking of a couple of people who were around then, and are still around now.

2. Work acquaintances.  I'm with these people about 50 hours per week, we have similar interests (this I believe is magnified the more specialized or technical a vocation may be),  and, frankly that's all it takes.  I can be friends with _anyone_ who likes computers.  Unless it's Windows, because fuck Windows.

3. "Adult" friends.  These are people who through complete happenstance, end up in my life.  Often more distantly, and for a shorter period of time.  The bond with this type of relationship is typically predicated on "stage of life" nonsense.  I.e. They have a job, I have a job, they have a kid, I have a kid, they have a Wife, I have a Wife, etc.  It's this type of relationship that I'm discussing here.

These relationships' bonds can grow stronger by adding facets.  Maybe we both work in technology, or both really life coffee, or enjoy similar subjective experiences (art).  Add enough facets, and this relationship may actually be strong enough gain tenure in my life.  However, the truth is, at least for me so far, they never make it long enough to survive.

This is the case of __adult onset friendship__.  Extremely rare.  Often times it can be misdiagnosed if discovered early, as it often clears up completely in a year's time.

The initial bond, "stage in life", is volatile.  Another kid, a promotion, a move, or a job loss severs the initial connection.  This severance is typically completely unexpected, and unexplained. And worse yet, it's unnoticed until it's far too late.  We realize we haven't seen this person for months, and then any attempt begins to feel forced, which just adds to the awkwardness of our innate desire to save face, at least until we just completely give up altogether.  This is where the speculation begins.  We blame them, ask ourselves , _"what did we do?"_, etc.  This builds up a completely one-sided narrative that our brains calcify as truth over time, until one day we run into this other human at Good 2 Go taco really early on a Sunday morning, and they stand and talk with you while you wait for your coffee.  Although normally you'd be cursing the barista for telling you, "we don't do pour overs on the weekend", you're actually thanking god that the slow bar is closed, so you can just get the hell of there and try and recover from the intensity of the situation.

This doesn't have to happen.

Even though a friendship may be based on shaky ground, it still exists.  Shaky ground is better than no ground at all, and when we start giving up altogether, that's where we end up; nowhere to stand.  I need to relax, just let bygones be assholes, and accept my adult friendship fate.  It is plentiful, and I am thankful.
