I just had an interesting discussion with my Wife.

Like the typical [gihugic](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gihugic) extended family, our kiddos all pick names, so us parents don't have to buy presents for all 47 kids.  This year, my daughter drew a cousin, an 8 year old boy.  Strange thing is, this is the third year in a row that we've drawn his name.  Previously, we'd bought him some kind of ball, as this was _literally_ all he was interested in at age 6 and 7.  However this year, being the wise woman that she is, my Wife did not capitulate to my suggestions; she asked the boy's Mother.

"He'd really like a gift card to iTunes or Game Stop."

When this data was relayed to me, my knee-jerk reaction was a cliche one: Oh kids these days.  Go out and fly a kite.  However on further thought, I was struck with a realization.

__We are raising a generation of non-hackers.__

8 years old may seem a little early to begin weeping for a generation, and I'm aware that it's unfair to compare the technical prerequisites of basic computer usage from when I was 8 to now, but try and bear with me on this logic.

* _An 8 year old who's been immersed in rich technology his whole life._  As adults, we tend to lend this innate comfort with an iPhone to precociousness. I think it's better suited to be called a novel evolutionary trait these more technologically exposed generations have developed.

* _Computers used to be hard to use._  Not just a long time ago, with DOS, Prodigy, and 28.8k modems, but even Windows 2000 and Napster required a little know how and technical savvy.  How did __you__ learn what a T3 was?

Our little protagonist has these two things working for him.  The point I'm trying to reach is this: At 8, he should have fairly close to the same reasonable technical opportunities that I did at 16.

At 16, my generation was learning how to query for media on the Internet, hack our way through obfuscated links, and mine for source files hidden in Javascript. His is learning to ask for iTunes cards for Christmas.  The next generation of computer users will never know what it's like to peruse message boards to find Mediafire links.  Sharing music with friends won't be about .rar files, it will be about Spotify playlists. New discoveries will be a result of nothing but a predictive algorithm.  The hacker generation dies with me, and complacency will be its replacement.

Although it may feel like I'm only waxing quixotic about a pre-cloud era, consider this:  It's these future generations who will define the future of our precious Open Web.  The longer a blissful ignorance is the norm, the more predictable a collapse of the Web as we know it will be.

Information should be free. Teach your kids.

Save the Web.
