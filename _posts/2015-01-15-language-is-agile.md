In a previous life, before computers, lexicography was thing I was into.  Maybe not lexicography exactly, but I was certainly a [logophile](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/logophile).  I became obsessed with common misnomers: nauseous vs. nauseated, myriad of vs. myriad, etc.  This obsession grew from reading a lot of stalward lexicographical traditionalists, namely David Foster Wallace.  He was notorious for painstakingly attending to syntactic perfection on a sentence-by-sentence basis, which is evident in Infinte Jest.  Being young and impressionable, I took someone far wiser's opinion on the topic and adopted their stalwardism as my own.  I liked to correct misnomers.

The other side of this argument has always been that language is fluid, that it's an organic construct that evolves with its consumers.  I said out loud that this idea was shit, and this fluidity was destroying our precious pearl.

Today, [PRI's The Takeaway](http://www.thetakeaway.org/story/the-takeaway-2015-01-15/) did a story on the [next iteration of Merriam-Webster's dictionary](http://www.thetakeaway.org/story/merriam-webster-charts-new-course-online/).  The primary point of the story had less to do with the fluidity of our lexicon, more to do with the "crazy idea" that the next MW Dictionary was going to be 100% online.  Shocking.  They did touch on this idea briefly, long enough to get my brain going on the topic.  The conversation drifted for a short time to an ex-MW lexicographer who jumped ship not only from the mothership, but the mothership's ideology to start [http://wordnik.com](http://wordnik.com).  A crowd sourced dictionary, and multi-purpose lexical tool.  Wordnik is cool and all, but the interesting thing here is that I found myself wholeheartedly agreeing with the ship-jumper.

### I'd come full circle.

Language is only as good as its use.  That is, it only exists as we use it.

Unlike traditional lexicographers and fretting old people, I know now that Language isn't in steady decline because we can't use wane correctly, but rather growing with us as our needs for it change.  Language is Agile, rapidly developing in realtime, adapting on the fly, and has essentially strayed completely from its initial specifications.  Let it go, and let it grow.  Relevance is a moving target, and our lexicon is following it.
