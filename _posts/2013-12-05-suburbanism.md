Meg and I have only lived in the city since we got married, and even before.  I've been no more that a few blocks from downtown Dallas since around 2003, minus a year long hiatus spent unemployed in southern California.  We recently made a trip up to McKinney and something _weird_ happened.  I suddenly had this inexplicable urge to leave the city limits.

We got stuck in a highway closure that forced us off of 75, past a tree-canopied park, and into a beautiful neighborhood.  We drove by the elementary school -- it was idyllic:  A thick coverage of leaves on probably an acre of space in which the school sat in the center.  Even though it was 2 p.m. on a sunny November afternoon, one would be hard-pressed to find a place in direct sunlight on account of all the century old Oak trees.  This school sat nestled in a maze of suburban brick homes with new yellow wood fences not yet stained gray by time.  A strange thing existed between each one of these houses:  _Space_.  I was suddenly struck with the notion of a house with enough room, one where I could have an office with a whiteboard, one with room for all of Meg's boots, one where the yard wasn't constantly being littered on by vagrant passers-by.

A seed has been planted.
