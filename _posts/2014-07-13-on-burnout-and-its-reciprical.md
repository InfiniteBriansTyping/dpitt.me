Passion breeds burnout; it’s undeniably true. We commit to something because we love it, and we are diven by our passion for it. This passion can push us into a position n which we are backed into a corner, or deeply buried, with only a hint of light on the horizon. Being in this position, or at least being held captive by it for long enough, results in burnout. Our passion drives us here. I know burnout as a short temper, a lack of sleep, or when I am sleeping, it’s in-and-out with lucid dreams that are laced with nonsensical solutions to whatever problem I fell asleep trying to solve. I know it as a complete loss of desire to learn or read anything new. A feeling that, every time a coworker or friend sends me a paper or something to read, I’m stuck with a complex set of emotions that includes both inferiority and frustration. I know it as an intellectual wall.

Having recently been dealing with a case of burnout that has stretched through more than a month, I began a desperate search for a solution. I thought: Side project? New research rabbit hole? I was suddenly struck with an idea:

__There is a time for all of us _before_ computers.__

I still like to think of myself as a muscisian, a person who reads (non-technical) things, and has opinions about art. It was this that I needed to be reminded of; that I existed, with passions, before I fell in love with computers. I find that a lot of my identity is wrapped up in what I do for a living. Perhaps because I’m a cliche, or a little narcissistic, but nonetheless, this is why I get lost in this negative feedback loop. It’s easy to find my way in, but my entire identity is based in not finding my out.

To remedy burnout, we have to find that thing that we loved before computers. It stems from the same source, but its effect is inherently less self-destructive.
